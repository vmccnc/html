South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg took a firm stance on candidates accepting election help from foreign actors, saying candidates should immediately alert the FBI if offered dirt on their opponents. "Just call the FBI. It's not hard. It's not complicated," Buttigieg told "Face the Nation" host Margaret Brennan in an interview.

Buttigieg condemned President Trump for saying in an interview with ABC News' George Stephanopoulos that he would accept election help from foreign countries and would not necessarily report it to the FBI. Mr. Trump said accepting foreign help is "not an interference" and that FBI Director Christopher Wray was "wrong" for saying candidates should immediately contact his agency in such cases.
